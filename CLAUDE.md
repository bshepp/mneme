## Project Overview

Mneme is an exploratory research system designed to detect field-like, emergent memory structures embedded in biological systems, beginning with planarian regeneration and bioelectric data. The project seeks to uncover attractor states, regulatory logic, and latent architectures not captured by sequence-based models alone.

## Project Architecture

The project is organized in phases:

1. **Phase 1: Synthetic Data Prototyping** - Develop and validate a modular analysis pipeline on synthetic field-like data inspired by planarian voltage maps and regenerative logic
2. **Phase 2: Real Bioelectric + Gene Expression Data** - Test Mneme on actual biological data, starting with planarian bioelectric images, gene expression overlays, and regeneration timelines
3. **Phase 3: Interpretation + Theory Development** - Formalize insights into a model of distributed memory encoding via fields in biological tissue

## Development Environment

- **Python Environment**: Uses a virtual environment in `venv/`
- **Primary Tools**: Python, Jupyter/Colab, NumPy, SciPy, PyTorch/Keras, PySR, GUDHI (for TDA)
- **Focus Areas**: Information Field Theory (IFT), dimensionality reduction, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), symbolic regression

## Key Technical Approaches

- Information Field Theory (IFT) reconstruction to interpolate continuous fields
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, autoencoders) to uncover latent spaces
- Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to identify persistent structures
- Symbolic regression to extract mathematical rules governing local field behaviors
- Bioelectric and gene expression field reconstruction
- Attractor detection and bifurcation analysis

## Development Commands

Since this is an early-stage research project, specific build/test/lint commands are not yet established. The project appears to be in the initial planning phase with a Python virtual environment set up for development.
